Record a <10 minute video of your presentation to your client and internal team members 

It is now time to record your presentation to the client.

Remember, your presentation should be concise, engaging and should tell a compelling story. It should be no longer than 10 minutes.

Recording the video may require a few attempts until youâ€™re happy with it, but this task shouldn't take you longer than 30 minutes.

While the recording functionality in this task won't allow you to share your slides as you speak, it will help you learn how to communicate and use eye contact when presenting.
